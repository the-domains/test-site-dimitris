## About Us

We are a team of experts in the game design area, as we own an escape room business. We started as gamers and loved it. So we decided why not create a room ourselves? And then it came the second, the third and so on. The goal was to create original puzzle ideas and cinematic feeling in all our rooms.

Next step was to create an escape room business to see how we will do. After the successful first step, came the next natural one. The good criticism we received, made us decide to start selling our rooms and even our name. Either with franchise options or one time fee. You can leave up to us the design and you concentrate on running your business!
